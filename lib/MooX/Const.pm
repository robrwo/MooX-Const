=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Moo;
  use MooX::Const;

  use Types::Standard -types;

  has thing => (
    is  => 'const',
    isa => ArrayRef[HashRef],
  );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is syntactic sugar for using L<Types::Const> with L<Moo>. The
SYNOPSIS above is equivalent to:

  use Types::Const -types;

  has thing => (
    is     => 'ro',
    isa    => Const[ArrayRef[HashRef]],
    coerce => 1,
  );

It modifies the C<has> function to support "const" attributes.  These
are read-only ("ro") attributes for references, where the underlying
data structure has been set as read-only.

This will return an error if there is no "isa", the "isa" is not a
L<Type::Tiny> type, if it is not a reference, or if it is blessed
object.

Simple value types such as C<Int> or C<Str> are silently converted to
read-only attributes.

As of v0.5.0, it also supports write-once ("once") attributes for
references:

  has setting => (
    is  => 'once',
    isa => HashRef,
  );

This allows you to set the attribute I<once>. The value is coerced
into a constant, and cannot be changed again.

Note that "wo" is a removed synonym for "once". It no longer works in
v0.6.0, since "wo" is used for "write-only" in some Moose-like
extensions.

As of v0.4.0, this now supports the C<strict> setting:

  has thing => (
    is     => 'const',
    isa    => ArrayRef[HashRef],
    strict => 0,
  );

When this is set to a false value, then the read-only constraint will
only be applied when running in strict mode, see L<Devel::StrictMode>.

If omitted, C<strict> is assumed to be true.

=head1 KNOWN ISSUES

Accessing non-existent keys for hash references will throw an
error. This is a feature, not a bug, of read-only hash references, and
it can be used to catch mistakes in code that refer to non-existent
keys.

Unfortunately, this behaviour is not replicated with array references.

See L<Types::Const> for other known issues related to the C<Const>
type.

=head2 Using with Moose and Mouse

This module appears to work with L<Moose>, and there is now a small
test suite.

It does not work with L<Mouse>. Pull requests are welcome.

=head1 SUPPORT FOR OLDER PERL VERSIONS

Since v0.6.0, the this module requires Perl v5.14 or later.

If you need this module on Perl v5.10, please use one of the v0.5.x
versions of this module.  Significant bug or security fixes may be
backported to those versions.
