# NAME

MooX::Const - Syntactic sugar for constant and write-once Moo attributes

# SYNOPSIS

```perl
use Moo;
use MooX::Const;

use Types::Standard -types;

has thing => (
  is  => 'const',
  isa => ArrayRef[HashRef],
);
```

# DESCRIPTION

This is syntactic sugar for using [Types::Const](https://metacpan.org/pod/Types%3A%3AConst) with [Moo](https://metacpan.org/pod/Moo). The
SYNOPSIS above is equivalent to:

```perl
use Types::Const -types;

has thing => (
  is     => 'ro',
  isa    => Const[ArrayRef[HashRef]],
  coerce => 1,
);
```

It modifies the `has` function to support "const" attributes.  These
are read-only ("ro") attributes for references, where the underlying
data structure has been set as read-only.

This will return an error if there is no "isa", the "isa" is not a
[Type::Tiny](https://metacpan.org/pod/Type%3A%3ATiny) type, if it is not a reference, or if it is blessed
object.

Simple value types such as `Int` or `Str` are silently converted to
read-only attributes.

As of v0.5.0, it also supports write-once ("once") attributes for
references:

```perl
has setting => (
  is  => 'once',
  isa => HashRef,
);
```

This allows you to set the attribute _once_. The value is coerced
into a constant, and cannot be changed again.

Note that "wo" is a removed synonym for "once". It no longer works in
v0.6.0, since "wo" is used for "write-only" in some Moose-like
extensions.

As of v0.4.0, this now supports the `strict` setting:

```perl
has thing => (
  is     => 'const',
  isa    => ArrayRef[HashRef],
  strict => 0,
);
```

When this is set to a false value, then the read-only constraint will
only be applied when running in strict mode, see [Devel::StrictMode](https://metacpan.org/pod/Devel%3A%3AStrictMode).

If omitted, `strict` is assumed to be true.

# INSTALLATION

The latest version of this module (along with any dependencies) can be installed from [CPAN](https://www.cpan.org) with the `cpan` tool that is included with Perl:

```
cpan MooX::Const
```

You can also extract the distribution archive and install this module (along with any dependencies):

```
cpan .
```

You can also install this module manually using the following commands:

```
perl Makefile.PL
make
make test
make install
```

If you are working with the source repository, then it may not have a `Makefile.PL` file.  But you can use the [Dist::Zilla](https://dzil.org/) tool in anger to build and install this module:

```
dzil build
dzil test
dzil install --install-command="cpan ."
```
